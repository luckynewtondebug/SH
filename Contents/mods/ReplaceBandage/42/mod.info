Well, fear not, because the "Nested Containers" mod is here to take the guesswork out of your inventory management. With this mod, you'll be able to see at a glance which bags have nested items without having to play a game of inventory Tetris. No more holding bags and shaking them to see what's inside - this mod has got your back. So, say goodbye to the days of rummaging through your bags and hello to the days of zombie slaying. Get the "Nested Containers" mod today and let the bags do the work for you!

TLDR - This mod lets you put containers inside containers such as your backpack inside the truck of your car letting you see the bag inside it without taking it out.
